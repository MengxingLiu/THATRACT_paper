# THATRACT_paper
This repository contains 

1) the tract parameters to reconstruct the first-order human thalamic white-matter tracts from DWI data, and 
2) the python scripts to measure the reproducibility of tract profiles and volume agreement between test-retest and several computaions.

This parameter works with RTP-pipeline version 4.3.5 (https://github.com/garikoitz/RTP-pipeline/tree/4.3.5).
